## About me

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/mugshot.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

Iâ€™m currently a PhD student studying computational plasma physics for nuclear fusion, based at [Culham Centre for Fusion Energy](https://ccfe.ukaea.uk/) near Oxford.
I run turbulence simulations on supercomputers to help predict if a fusion reactor will melt itself.

To help make scientist's work easier, I contribute to the open-source scientific software ecosystem, in particular to the [xarray library](https://github.com/pydata/xarray).

I'm also very worried about the implications of humanity's ongoing destruction and pollution of the biosphere, and spend a lot of my time trying to help put out this fire.
