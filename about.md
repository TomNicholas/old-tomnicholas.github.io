## About me

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/mugshot.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

I'm a physicist and software engineer. 

Currently I work at [[C]Worthy](https://cworthy.org/), a non-profit [focused research organisation](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00018-5) building tools to verify that ocean-based carbon dioxide removal approaches would be effective and safe.

Previously I worked as a Research Software Engineer and Oceanographer at Columbia University. I worked with Ryan Abernathey as part of the [Climate Data Science Lab](https://ocean-transport.github.io/cds_lab.html), and as part of Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.

Before that I did a PhD in computational plasma physics for nuclear fusion, based at [Culham Centre for Fusion Energy](https://ccfe.ukaea.uk/) near Oxford. My thesis involved running turbulence simulations on supercomputers to help predict if a fusion reactor will melt itself. If you want to know what I think about fusion now then read [this article](https://tom-nicholas.com/blog/theconversation-fusion/) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05727) that I wrote.

To help make scientist's work easier, I contribute to the open-source scientific software ecosystem, in particular to the [Xarray library](https://github.com/pydata/xarray) and various other projects within the [Pangeo](https://github.com/pangeo-data) sphere.

I'm generally very worried about the implications of humanity's ongoing destruction and pollution of the biosphere, and feel that we all have a responsibility to help put out this fire.
